This data science project involves analyzing and modeling sensor data from a slab continuous casting machine. The primary objective is to visualize critical patterns and apply unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to predict and detect mold breakouts, especially sticking-type breakouts and control casting speed to prevent breakouts using real time temperature data. 
A breakout is the unexpected leakage of molten steel from the mold during continuous casting, often causing production disruption and equipment damage. A breakout with no fixed thermocouple signature refers to a situation where the temperature sensors (thermocouples) do not display any consistent or predictable pattern before the breakout occurs. This makes early detection difficult, as the usual thermal warning signs are absent or irregular.
Tools used: Python (pandas, NumPy, sklearn, imblearn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn), Spyder (IDE)
